# Chronos

Chronos is a time system that splits the day into 16 * 16 * 16 * 16 parts instead of the usual 24 * 60 * 60. It displays this time using four hexadecimal digits. For example, 0000 is the start of the day, 8000 is half way through the day and FFFF is the last part of the day.

## Usage

Run `chronos` after installing.
